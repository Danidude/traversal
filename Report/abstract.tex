A crisis situation onboard a ship can be both deadly and confusing. This project report describes algorithms used 
to assist passengers in reaching their exits as quick and safe as possible.The algorithms could in the future be used
in a mobile phone application, providing passengers in a dangerous situation a safe passage out of it. The focus of
the project has been on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm which mimicks the behavior of ants when foraging for
food. The ships have been modeled as undirected graphs with nodes representing rooms and vertices indicating
that the rooms are connected. The graphs were both randomly and manually constructed to investigate
whether this affected the results of the algorithms. In the end the results shows that the ACO algorithm finds the
optimal path within an acceptable timeframe and that it warants further development of the model as a whole.
