\section{Conclusion}
%\emph{``My conclusion offers a compelling final comment to my argument, one that is persuasive for my
%intended audience.''}
Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) is just as good as brute force as long as there are enough ants building the path for the system. It is also more cost effective on taking up resources on the system it is running on, as brute force need a lot of resources and ACO not. When the graphs gets bigger, you need more ants to be sure that you get the right paths to save most people, tho it is not a huge increase when creating bigger graphs.
