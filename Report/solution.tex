\section{Implementation}

The ship was modeled out as a graph with nodes and connections. There was used two different types of graph when testing, one which was created manually and one that was randomly made each time. The nodes themselves represented a room onboard the ship and the connections from that room to another room, so that you could go from one room to another and back again. The nodes could hold some different parameters as if they were an exit so the passengers could get to safety or if they were lethal. In this project we only used 1 or 0, where 1 was 100% chance of death and 0 was 0%, however we had implemented it so it was possible to set other chances.

The main algorithms that was used to find its way through the graph was a brute force, random and Ant Colony optimization. Brute force was the first algorithm to run, so it could find all the best paths for the passengers to find an exit, also if we used randomly generated graph to see if the passengers had a way to an exit or was cut off. Then just moving the passengers randomly across the graph to see if they did find their way to an exit or died in a lethal node. If it happened so they could not get to an exit as there was no possible way for them to go, we counted them as dead. In real situations, the possibility of people getting stuck like this is unlikely, however it might happen if parts of the ship collapses.

In our Ant Colony algorithm, it started out the same way as random, by walking through the graph to find an exit. Once if do find an exit, it reports back in each node it visited and adds pheromones based on how long the path was and how lethal it was. Since we only used 1 and 0 in this situation, it would only increase the pheromones when there was no lethal nodes. Then it does the same again, walk around a bit less randomly, as the pheromones gives a higher chance of choosing the same path as the previous one. After some turns a path will develop as the AntSystem walks through the graph from an node to the exit.
